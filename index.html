         <h1>ABOUT</h1>
         <p>Ecash's vision is to bring global financial freedom and this involves giving power back to the masses. However, to do this there has to be a greater adoption of the eCash crypto currency. In a very competitive Blockchain industry this is becoming increasingly hard due to the fact that eCash is a completely decentralized currency which makes it difficult to attract investment for development and advertising. So what needs to be done? Well, the community is all we have to bring about the  success of this idea and that's where eFan comes in.
            eFan seeks to be an ecosystem that drives the adoption of eCash by using innovative technological solutions to bring about this wider adoption. For eCash to truly serve its purpose, it has to be desired for something more than its value appreciation or the it's potential to hit an all time high. It should be used to purchase products and services.  With some blockchain projects, their currency has the ability to purchase NFT's and this increases the desirability of them, however with eCash until the Introduction of eFan eCash was mainly a speculative investment. The introduction of services like eFan Jobs. e2Local and more will bring greater usage of eCash and these are services eFan has set out to create.

         <h1>Words From Founder</h1>
         <p>
            I had earlier thought to introduce an eCash faucet because I thought this would bring about greater adoption. Although the faucet is still to be made accessible to ecashers, I was amazed by the support I got from the community on the day of anouncement. An X post by one of the eCashers(@eCashglobal) improved my view of what I wanted eCash to be and where I wanted to see it go. He said I quote "Take your time and build some magic ðŸª„" and that is what I'm now dedicating my self to do for this community and to see that the financial freedom most talked about is brought by eCash. I am a Zimbabwean and you will hardly come across anyone who knows about crypto and if they do, chances are they don't trust it because of some past experience. However our local currency is ever depreciating and historically Zimbabwe has never had success when it comes to having a local currency and I see eCash as a potential fit for this country so how do we bring eCash to Zimbabweans? Well, that led me to one of my many ideas and projects for eCash and that is eCash2Local(e2Local). If you want to bring an alternative solution a peer to peer exchange that allows people to exchange their local currency to eCash is one way to do it until they see the alternative as the best form of money. This will likely be the case considering that the rate of the Zimbabwean dollar as of today is about ZWL 6500 to 1 USD and it gets worse when you look at the digital version known as the Rtgs which is valued at 17300 - 1 USD depending on who you buy from. Zimbabweans have completely lost faith in this economy and are seeking ways to run away. I have shared this to show how a eCash can make things easier in some countries like mine and maybe to show some what eCash could be to some people.
